# reg4D
-----

Applies pre-computed (affine) linear and non-linear transforms to 4D EP (bold) image data in parallel.
Additional options include the ability to resample the image back to its native voxel size and/or native
space dimensions (in the case a native space image is provided).

Using this script requires that both FSL and MIRTK are installed and added to the system path.
